Charity Website

This repository hosts the code for a charity fundraising website, aiming to support various causes by enabling users to create and contribute to fundraisers. 

The project is divided into two main parts:
- **Frontend**: Built with HTML and CSS, providing an accessible and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Developed with Python, handling data processing, user management, and secure payment integrations.

Our goal is to create a transparent and easy-to-use platform for charitable giving.
